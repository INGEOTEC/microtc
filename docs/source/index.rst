A great variety of text tasks such as topic or spam identification,
user profiling, and sentiment analysis can be posed as a supervised
learning problem and tackled using a text classifier. A text
classifier consists of several subprocesses, some of them are general
enough to be applied to any supervised learning problem, whereas
others are specifically designed to tackle a particular task using
complex and computational expensive processes such as lemmatization,
syntactic analysis, etc. Contrary to traditional approaches,
:math:`\mu\text{TC}` is a minimalist and multi-propose text-classifier able to tackle
tasks independently of domain and language.

:math:`\mu\text{TC}` core entry point is :py:class:`microtc.textmodel.TextModel` which
can be seen as a function with the form
:math:`m(\text{text}) \rightarrow \Re ^d` where :math:`d`
is the vocabulary, i.e., the dimension of the *vector space*. As can
be seen, :math:`m` can be used to transform a text into a vector, and,
consequently, it can be used to transform a training set of pairs,
text and label, into a training set of pairs, vectors and label, which
can be directly used by any supervised
learning algorithm to obtain a **text classifier**.

:py:class:`microtc.textmodel.TextModel` follows the idea of http://scikit-learn.org
transformers. That is, it implements a method
:py:func:`microtc.textmodel.TextModel.fit` that receives the training
set and a method :py:func:`microtc.textmodel.TextModel.transform` that
receives a list of texts and returns and sparse matrix that correspond
to the representation of the given texts in the vector space.

:math:`\mu\text{TC}` is described in
`An Automated Text Categorization Framework based on Hyperparameter Optimization <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705118301217>`_.

Quickstart Guide
===================

We have decided to make a live quickstart guide, it covers the
installation, and the use of :math:`\mu\text{TC}` with different parameters. 
Finally, the notebook can be found at the docs directory on GitHub.

	  pip install microtc


Text Model
=============

This is class is :math:`\mu\text{TC}` main entry, it receives a
corpus, i.e., a list of text and builds a text model from it.
