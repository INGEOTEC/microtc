microTC is a minimalist text classifier, that is, it is designed to tackle text-classification problems in an agnostic way,
being both domain and language independent. 

microTC is intentionally simple, so only a small number of features
were implemented. However, it uses a some complex tools from numpy
and scikit-lean. The number of dependencies is limited and fulfilled
by almost any Scientific Python distributions, e.g., `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.

The documentation is on `readthedocs <https://microtc.readthedocs.io>`_.
